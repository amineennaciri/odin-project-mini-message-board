# odin-project-mini-message-board
This is the mini message board project from TOP(the odin project) Full Stack JavaScript course.

This project is about building a super simple message baord using Express to make a fun interactive web app.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in setting up a web app using node.js and express.

Self-reflection and conclusion: project completed, great opportunity to practice setting routes and building a server from scratch. the idea to use a form to update the home page was great in order to give this basic app some complexity.
